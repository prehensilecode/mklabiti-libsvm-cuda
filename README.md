CUDA: GPU-accelerated LIBSVM
====
**LIBSVM Accelerated with GPU using the CUDA Framework**

GPU-accelerated LIBSVM is a modification of the [original LIBSVM](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) that exploits the CUDA framework to significantly reduce processing time while producing identical results. The functionality and interface of LIBSVM remains the same. The modifications were done in the kernel computation, that is now performed using the GPU.

Watch a [short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fl99tQQd55U) on the capabilities of the GPU-accelerated LIBSVM package

###CHANGELOG
V1.2.3.1
    Removed specific CUDA version (compiles and links with CUDA 9.0)
    Use CUBLAS that is distributed with CUDA 9.0
	
V1.2 
	
	Updated to LIBSVM version 3.17
	Updated to CUDA SDK v5.5
	Using CUBLAS_V2 which is compatible with the CUDA SDK v4.0 and up.

Discussion

    GPU-accelerated LIBSVM gives a performance gain depending on the size of input data set. 
    This gain is increasing dramatically with the size of the dataset.
    Please take into consideration input data size limitations that can occur from the memory 
    capacity of the graphics card that is used.

### FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)

* Is there a GPU-accelerated LIBSVM version for Matlab?

We are interested in porting our imlementation in Matlab but due to our workload, it is not in our immediate plans. Everybody is welcome to make the port and we can host the ported software.

* Visual Studio will not let me build the provided project.

The project has been built in both 32/64 bit mode. If you are working on 32 bits, you might need the x64 compiler for Visual Studio 2010 to build the project.

* Building the project, I get linker error messages.

Please go to the project properties and check the library settings. CUDA libraries have different names for x32 / x64. Make sure that the correct path and filenames are given.

* I have built the project but the executables will not run (The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is in
correct.)

Please update the VS2010 redistributables to the PC you are running your executable and install all the latest patches for visual studio.

* My GPU-accelerated LIBSVM is running smoothly but i do not see any speed-up.

GPU-accelerated LIBSVM is giving speed-ups mainly for big datasets. In the GPU-accelerated implementation some extra time is needed to load the data to the gpu memory. If the dataset is not big enough to give a significant performance gain, the gain is lost due to the gpu-memory -> cpu-memory, cpu-memory -> gpu-memory  transfer time. Please refer to the graph above to have a better understanding of the performance gain for different dataset sizes.
Problems also seem to arise when the input dataset contains values with extreme differences (e.g. 107) if no scaling is performed. Such an example is the "breast-cancer" dataset provided in the official LIBSVM page.
